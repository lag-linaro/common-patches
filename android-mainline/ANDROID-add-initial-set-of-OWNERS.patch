Subject: ANDROID: add initial set of OWNERS

In order to provide better reviewer suggestions and to introduce fine
grained additional approval permissions, sprinkle some OWNERS files over
the tree.

This essentially grants additional OWNERS permissions in
  - net/
  - arch/arm*/net
  - arch/x86/net
  - drivers/net
  - fs/crypto
  - fs/f2fs
  - fs/verity

All other permissions are already covered by ref/meta/config:OWNERS.
