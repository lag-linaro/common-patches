Subject: UPSTREAM: fuse: fix matching of FUSE_DEV_IOC_CLONE command

With commit f8425c939663 ("fuse: 32-bit user space ioctl compat for fuse
device") the matching constraints for the FUSE_DEV_IOC_CLONE ioctl command
are relaxed, limited to the testing of command type and number.  As Arnd
noticed, this is wrong as it wouldn't ensure the correctness of the data
size or direction for the received FUSE device ioctl.

Fix by bringing back the comparison of the ioctl received by the FUSE
device to the originally generated FUSE_DEV_IOC_CLONE.
