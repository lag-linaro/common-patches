Subject: ANDROID: sched/fair: Do not sync task util with SD_BALANCE_FORK

When android_rvh_select_task_rq_fair is enabled,
the woken-up new fair task's utilization is always updated in
a wakeup path (wake_up_new_task) although it doesn't have to be.
It is because sync_entity_load_avg() is always called in
select_task_rq_fair() with the hook enabled.

Let's see what happened:

The new task's sched_avg->last_update_time should be 0
unless it is updated in attach_entity_cfs_rq() in the wakeup path.

But because sync_entity_load_avg() is called,
sched_avg->last_update_time is updated with cfs_rq->avg.last_update_time
before attach_entity_cfs_rq() is called.

After updated, post_init_entity_util_avg() is called and the half of
spare capacity of rq which the task is assigned to is set to the task's
utilization.

Finally, update_load_avg() is called and check the task's
sched_avg->last_update_time, and update the task's utilization due to
non-zero last_update_time.

- wake_up_new_task()
  - select_task_rq() <-- task's sched_avg->last_update_time is set
  			 if android_rvh_select_task_rq_fair is enabled.
  - post_init_entity_util_avg() <-- task gets the half of spare cap.
    - attach_entity_cfs_rq()
      - update_load_avg <-- update task's utiliztion because
                            task's sched_avg->last_update_time is not 0.

Make sure not to call sync_entity_load_avg() in select_task_rq_fair()
when SD_BALANCE_FORK is also set with the hook.
