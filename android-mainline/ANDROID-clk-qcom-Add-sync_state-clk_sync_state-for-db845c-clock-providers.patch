Subject: ANDROID: clk: qcom: Add sync_state = clk_sync_state for db845c clock
 providers

In order to utilize Saravana's new clk handling code,
we need to set the sync_state functions to be
clk_sync_state for the clock providers on db845c.

This allows display to properly come up when trying to
load the display driver as a module.
